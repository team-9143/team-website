        <b>Is this BattleBots?</b>
      <br>
        No. As sick as BattleBots is, this is high school robotics. Unfortunately, no cool weapons are allowed to be used to destroy other teams' robots in competition. Instead, robots are designed to compete in competitions like First Robotics Competition (FRC), where a robot is designed to compete in an annual challenge. Robotics aims to inspire students to learn skills in STEM while fostering teamwork, problem-solving skills, and creativity.

        <b>What do you do in robotics?</b>
      <br>
        In robotics, a team plans, designs, builds, and then tests a robot while incorporating numerous engineering and business principals such as: programming, design/CAD, machining, teambuilding, and PR/Outreach. Then, the robot is brought to various competitions like First Robotics Competition (FRC). In addition, the robot is also brought to non-competitive events like parades or fairs in order to spread awareness about the team.

        <b>Do I need experience to do robotics?</b>
      <br>
        Absolutely not! All you need to get into robotics is an interest in math, science, and engineering and the willingness to learn about the robot. Many people do not start robotics until high school, but by the end of high school, end up loving it and learning plenty of skills along the way.

        <b>What does the robot do?</b>
      <br>
        Each year, a new robot is designed and built in a way that will fit the criteria and constraints for competitions (mainly FRC) and be able to get through obstacles. Generally, the robot is able to drive around at different speeds and/or manipulate game pieces like cubes or cones. The robot is designed to excel at competitions while also being conveniently maneuverable.

        <b>How much of a commitment is robotics?</b>
      <br>
        Robotics is the closest thing to a sport without being a traditional "sport," especially when it comes to commitment. Just like you would practice a ton for games and tournaments in a sport, robotics requires a hefty time commitment during the winter and spring (multiple times a week, sometimes weekends), which is the main season. This is mainly when the team would travel to tournaments, local or far. However, the team also goes to events and meets often during the spring and fall.

        <b>What are competitions like?</b>
      <br>
        Competitions are lively and intense, and depending on the one being attended, there can be over thousands of teams competing. In addition, there are a multitude of awards that can be won, not just first, second, or third place. For example, a Safety Award is given to the team considered the safest at FRC. The games at these competitions are usually centered around alliances with other teams and moving some sort of object in order to gain points. These competitions usually last 3 days and can be far away, and teams will stay in hotels, eat, and hangout together.
